The contract's original owner could use this button to renounce the ownership in favor of the dead address,
in order to lock the contract forever, which they did, back when FEG token launched in 2021.

The current owner of the contract can use this option to transfer ownership to a new wallet address,
however FEG's ownership was already renounced in favor to the dead wallet, so this option here serves
no purpose any more.
